I am a MTFTestCase which provide operations for UI-testing a SqueakSheet. I can easily interact with and navigate through a sheet window. I support staging, which means I defer test methods marked with a <longstage> pragma and only run them if I am run in longStage mode. If I am executed on TravisCI, I am in long stage mode. When run on short stage, I defer parts of the fixtures I am asked to run tests on. I try to isolate my execution from the containing image, e. g. by hiding and managing all windows opened during test execution. I provide a random generator and constant testing data for my tests.

I have such an elaborate scope that my developers became addicted to me and wrote nearly all tests for SqueakSheet using my UI framework.
