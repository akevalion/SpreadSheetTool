I represent a true Smalltalk formula of a SqueakSheet cell. I am executed in the context of templateMethod which provides access to the subject (self) as well as other cells of my containing sheet (cell). I support automatic evaluation of all my clients whenever I changed. I can be compiled and evaluated separately, but I am also capable of holding a pure string.

Implementation notes about the server/client pattern:
I use the observer pattern on two layers. The outer layer is foreign servers, that can be arbitrary models which send `self changed: #output with: aServer` to inform me that one of my servers changed. The inner layer is for servers that are cell formulae, too, and can be signaled sending `self changed: #server with: aCellFormula`. The reason for this differenciation is we want to ensure a consistent display of all formulae, especially in case of an arising cyclic reference, so I need the possibility to completely roll back the latest computation. While I can and must notify other cell formulae about a change during computation, I must never inform my model about the change before all my clients are proven not to create a cylic reference.
I also store my servers (that are cell formulae) separated to release them when I am recomputed and do no longer refer to them.
