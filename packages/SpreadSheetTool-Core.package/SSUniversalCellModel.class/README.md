I display the contents of a SqueakSheet cell. These contents can be linked to an aspect of my tool's subject, wherefore I contain a getter and a setter formula. I can contain an arbitrary Model for displaying and manipulating my contents, and a SSModelConfiguration that describes how to communicate with this Model. Depending on the current sheet's settings, I automatically synchronize my model with the observed subject's aspect. I can also delegate the control of my formulae to the model.
